## Monty-Hall Game

The game is based on a tv show that the presenter asks a candidate to choose a door. After choosing the door, the presenter starts opening empty doors and asks the candidate if he wants to keep the door choosed or change it.

Here, you choose the door that has the present and how many doors it will have (max of 100 and min of 3 doors). After choosing the door, just start the game and you'll see the doors to be choosen.

To choose a door, just select it area. To open a door, just click on door handle. To restart the game, just select the button "Reiniciar jogo". To better experience, choose low number of doors and open the browser on full screen if using computer (F11 hotkey).

## Conclusion

This game was created as a lesson of the ReactJs + NextJs course that I'm actually studying.
There is a lot of additions of my part and fixes as well to be able to run on mobile and web browsers in a responsive way.
